# Overview
Building with a programming language goes beyond syntax, it also involves understanding how to structure a project, use external libraries, and create software that is easy to run, understand, and maintain. This project was created as a way to strengthen my skills using JavaScript.

The software is a task manager through command lines built with Node.js. It allows users to add tasks, view a list of existing tasks, and remove tasks through a simple interactive menu displayed in the terminal. The application demonstrates JS concepts such as functions, arrays, recursion, error handling, and the use of third-party libraries.

The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript outside of the browser environment, practice writing clean code, and gain experience working with 'npm packages' and terminal applications.

# Development Environment
This project was developed using VSCode as the primary code editor and Node.js as the runtime environment. Git was used for version control, and the project is hosted in a public GitHub repository called "javascript-task-manager".

The programming language used is JavaScript. The project also makes use of external libraries installed via 'npm', including 'Chalk' for styling terminal output and 'Readline' for handling user input from the command line.

# Future Work
- Improve input validation and error handling for unexpected user input  
- Add data persistence so tasks can be saved between sessions  
- Refactor the code to support additional features such as task categories or due dates
